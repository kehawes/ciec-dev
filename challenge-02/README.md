## Ask
- Please find two files `input_fqdn.csv` and `sample_output.csv`. 

- `input_fqdn.csv` should be used as input to your solution code and `sample_output.csv` file as name suggests is just sample output we expect.

- Your task is to take a file as input and based on fqdn/website address in the file extract bellow three values
   - IP : IPv4 address DNS will give for that websites/fqdn. 
   - DNS_time_ms : Time in ms your code took to resolve DNS and get IP.
   - HTTP_handshake_time_ms : Time in ms your code took to make http Request handshake to website/fqdn's. 

- Use your preferred Programming/Scripting language to code your solution.

- In your solution code try to handle all the possible cases and errors. 

- Try pay attention to improve scalability(when list has 50,000+ websites), reliability, fastness, maintainability, observability, testability, deployability of your code.

- As stretch goal, think about containerization of code for deployment & to have dependency requirements freeze

- Hint: you may need to import few Network Programming Modules

- Submit/commit your code as a new file/s to your personal repo folder named challenge-02

- Please provide complete written instructions on how to use your solution files. Like how to run, build, deploy..etc
